Group delay outliers were processed and editing info has been updated.
Troposphere and cable cal status for standard solution have been stored.
Observation dependent contribution status has been stored.
Reweighting updated for:
IS-SV IS-WE SV-WE 
Solution data configuration: group delays with ionosphere corrections
Clock and atmosphere constraint information saved.
Batchmode clock parameterization saved.
Batchmode atmosphere parameterization saved.
Ionosphere corrections were evaluated for group delays.
